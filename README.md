# Carnival-Cruise-Case-Study

## Project Overview
This project focuses on a case study for Carnival Corporation, specifically analyzing the demand and optimization for their World Cruise offering operated by P&O Cruises UK. The analysis uses historical data to estimate future demand, optimize passenger allocations, and develop overbooking strategies. 

## Repository Contents
- `Carnival_Cruises_Case_Study_3.pptx`: Presentation detailing the analysis and recommendations.
- `WorldCruiseSummary2024.xlsx`: Summary of realized demand, average prices, and durations for each route.
- `WorldCruiseData2024.csv`: Comprehensive dataset listing all bookings, cabin types, durations, booking and cancellation weeks, regions, prices, and number of people.

## Requirements
- Microsoft Excel or compatible software for viewing `.xlsx` files.
- CSV reader or spreadsheet software for viewing `.csv` files.
- Microsoft PowerPoint or compatible software for viewing `.pptx` files.

## Analysis and Findings
### Scenarios for Demand in 2025
We provide two scenarios for estimating demand for each cabin type and route in 2025 based on assumptions about market trends and historical data:
1. **Scenario 1**: Continuation of current market trends with moderate growth in short-route demand.
2. **Scenario 2**: Increased marketing efforts leading to significant growth in short-route demand.

### Optimal Passenger Allocation
Using the demand estimates from the scenarios, we optimized passenger allocations to maximize revenue. Recommendations include adjustments to current allocations and considerations for promotional activities to attract more passengers.

### Cancellation Rates Estimation
We analyzed the 2022 cancellation data to estimate cancellation rates for different sectors of the world cruise. These estimates are used to inform overbooking strategies for 2025.

### Overbooking Strategies
Based on estimated cancellation rates, we developed overbooking strategies for different routes. These strategies aim to balance the risks of overbooking with the potential revenue gains.

## Recommendations
Carnival UK should consider the following based on our analysis:
1. **Adjust allocations**: Increase allocations for high-demand short routes.
2. **Promotional campaigns**: Invest in marketing to boost demand, especially for underperforming routes.
3. **Overbooking**: Implement strategic overbooking to mitigate cancellations while maximizing occupancy and revenue.

## Presentation
The findings and recommendations are summarized in the `Carnival_Cruises_Case_Study_3.pptx` presentation. Key points are highlighted to provide clear and actionable insights for the Carnival UK RM team.
